                    <p>I am Vishnu Chelle, pursuing Masters in Computer Science at University of Missouri Kansas City.
                        I received my Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University, Bangalore, India.
                        After my Bachelors I have worked for Accenture Ltd., India, as Software Engineering Analyst for more than two years.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was born and raised in India. From childhood I was interested towards scientific discoveries and innovations.
                        Initially I was bewildered by the complexity of technology involved.  More vitally, this has enforced in me the schematic of scientific approach to problem analysis and solution.
                        It did not take much time for me to realize the wonders which can be created by technology and since then had an eagerness to learn more about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Realising my interest toward computer technologies, I admittedly spend most of my time in front of a screen playing with
                        different programming languages, tools, technologies, algorithms and their implementations. I autonomously deliver products from concept to launch providing
                        awesome user experience, optimized code and great documentation. I am a true perfectionist and believe that there is always room for improvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>I always look forward to meet interesting people and open for discussing new ideas. Also in search for a right place
                        where I can strengthen my perception about computer programming.
